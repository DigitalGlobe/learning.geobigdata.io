        learning.” -- @johnny.riskas
      </p>
      <p>
        "a practical approach... writing code sooner than later — fastai courses
        are probably a good example of this, but unfortunately make heavy use of
        their own libraries" -- @colllin

        “I found the Udemy AZ courses useful for learning more about the Python
        Libraries associated with Machine Learning (SK Learn, Pytorch,
        TensorFlow, Keras). I personally found the math/theory in these classes
        to be a little light, but I think for most people interested in learning
        the fundamentals of ML, it will more than suffice. There are a couple of
        good image classifier examples in each course that I found particularly
        useful for my work at DG.” -- @chloe

        “The Bloomberg "Foundations of Machine Learning" training course is
        designed for internal company's software engineers. There are 30
        lectures which are comprehensive and move at a good pace. The key is
        that these are challenging and the lecture time is well spent covering
        each concept. There are supplied Lecture Slides. Understanding these
        concepts gives a good foundation when applied.” -- @mikesmith
