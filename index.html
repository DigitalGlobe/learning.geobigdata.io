  <h2>100 Hours of ML</h2>
  <p>
    “100 hours of ML” is a community of DigitalGlobe employees committed to
    completing 100 hours of self-paced learning on Machine Learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    This program is inclusive and open to beginner and experts. "100 hours" has
    a list of suggested resources at specific levels, as well as reviews of the
    resources by your DG colleagues to help you decide where to start.
    Additionally, the #100-hours-of-ml slack channel will serve as a community
    for people to ask questions, share valuable resources they come across, and
    share their progress on this ML learning journey.
